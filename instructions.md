# How to use VSCode Terminal Capture

## Getting Started 

To get started you need to search vscode terminal capture in the vscode extension store, and download the extension there. Once you have clicked on install and the installation has finished the extension is now ready for use.

## How to use

Using the Terminal capture is very simple to grasp and get started with. To start all you need is a terminal window within VSCode open and for there to be input in the terminal. 

Once you have input in the terminal you can decide whether to keep adding more input or to activate the terminal capture tool to create a text file with all of the input and output from the terminal inside it. **Activating the capture command** requires the user to open the command palette for VSCode and to enter 'Terminal: Capture'.

Once the user has triggered the command, the contents of the terminal goes into the text file and the terminal is cleared. During this time the user can go into the text file and make necessary adjustments, changes, and notes to the termial content.

After the user is done making their desired changes, they will need to adjust the line their curser is on. The reason that they **must** make this adjustment is so that when they run the 'Terminal: Capture' command again it does not append the new content of the terminal to somewhere unwanted.

Once the user runs the command again the same steps should be followed as before and when they would like to go back to writing in the open terminal they should make sure they adjust their curser to a line below their existing notes and terminal output.
